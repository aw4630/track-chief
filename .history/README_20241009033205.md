<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>If you've ever commuted to and from New York Penn Station using NJ Transit, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>
<i>They call it the pit, the rush, the meat grinder...</i><br/>

<br/>
Essentially, NJ Transit commuter trains departing from NY Penn Station <b>do not announce the track until about 10 minutes prior</b> to scheduled departure. Imagine you're waiting in the main concourse for the scheduled 6:36 PM Northeast Corridor Line (NEC) train bound for Trenton. Suddenly, the track number pops up on the departure screen, and it's a mad rush to get to the platform first, so that you can secure your seat on the busy train. <br/>
